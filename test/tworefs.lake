#AUTOTEST

# This is a minimal test case for the GC. It pushes a literal and makes
# a duplicate. It then gc's pop's and gc's again. Only the pinned object should remain.

# Literal pinned object (never gc'ed)
push int 789

# Create a new copy
dup

# This shouldn't do anything, both objects live
gc

pop

# This should now collect the dup
gc

# Stack should now only contain the pinned "789" value
