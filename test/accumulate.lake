# Sums integers using "accumulate"
#
# An accumulator takes a binary function and applies it over a variable
# number of input argument, reducing to a single result.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Values to sum. This is fed into a vector which is fed to std::accumulate
# NOTE: you can also push arrays (the value count is the number of arrays, not elements, in that case)
push int 1; push int 2; push int 3; push int 4; push int 5

# Value count, so we know how many values to expect on the stack
push int 5

# Initial value for accumulation. For summing, let's start with 0
push int 0

# Accumulator which adds

    add
